        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>"The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear." - Rumi</p>
        <p>Our retreats are inspired by the belief that true relaxation comes from within. By disconnecting from the hustle and bustle of daily life, we create space to reconnect with ourselves. The serene surroundings, combined with the practice of yoga, help to cultivate a deep sense of peace and clarity.</p>
